# Database for a cooking show

## Description
This was a 3-person group project completed as part of the Databases course at NTUA.
We designed a database by developing a relational schema, creating an ER diagram and writing SQL queries.
We also wrote an extensive report, detailing our design decisions and implementation.

Originally, the repository for the project was created by one of my teammates. I decided to remove the forked relationship between his repository and mine, in order to rewrite the README section and change the repository's title. Apart from these changes, the repository contents remain unchanged.

## Contents
In the repository, you may find the SQL query files, mock data files and the full project report, written in Greek. The report contains detailed instructions for downloading and using the database from both the user's and administrator's perspectives. Personal information has been redacted from the report to preserve privacy.
