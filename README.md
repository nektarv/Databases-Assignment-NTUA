#Database for a cooking show

##Description
This was a 3-person group project conducted as part of the Databases course at NTUA.
We designed a database, for which we developed a relational schema, designed an ER diagram and wrote queries in SQL.
We also included an extensive report, detailing the the design decisions and implementation.

In the 18th page of the report, you can find a link to the original repository, created by one of my teammates. I decided to remove the forked relationship between his repository and mine, in order to rewrite the README section and change the title of the repo. Otherwise, the contents of the repository remain unchanged.

##Contents
In the files included, you may find the SQL queries, mock data files and the full project report, written in Greek. Within the report, you may also find detailed instructions on how to download and use the database, both from the user's and administrator's perspectives. Personal information has been redacted from the report to preserve privacy.
