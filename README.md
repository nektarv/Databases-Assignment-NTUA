#Database for a cooking show

This was a 3-person group project conducted as part of the Databases course at NTUA.
We designed a database, for which we developed a relational schema, designed an ER diagram and wrote queries in SQL.
We also included an extensive report, detailing the the design decisions and implementation.

In the 18th page of the report, you can find a link to the original repository, created by one of my teammates. I decided to remove the forked relationship between his repository and mine, in order to rewrite the README section and change the title of the repo.
